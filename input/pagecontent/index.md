## Introduction
### Purpose
A lot of the focus on interoperability and exchanging of clinical data has been around mainstream EHRs.  However, there are a lot of clinical data systems that deal with specialty care, such as eyecare, dental, chiropractic and physiotherapy, to name a few examples.  This implementation guide (IG) provides consistent guidance for capturing key eyecare testing information in healthcare information technology (HIT) products.

### Audience
The audience for this IG includes architects and developers of eyecare HIT systems that exchange patient clinical data.  Business analysts and policy managers can also benefit from a basic understanding of the use of CDA templates across multiple implementation use cases.

### Design Considerations
This guide specifies a template based on the Physical Exam section that defines the eyecare examination codes along with the use of a Eyecare Results Organizer entry.  This Eyecare Exam template can be used in any of the existing C-CDA document types that include a Physical Exam section.
The data elements represented in this guide are based on commonly used terms across the industry.  Many of these data elements are captured in Eyecare EHRs today.
